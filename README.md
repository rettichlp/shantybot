This bot was created for the Minecraft Server ShantyTown (shantytown.eu) to provide some useful features for the community.
Features are focused on the Minecraft server, so this bot won't work properly on other servers.
For this reason the sourcecode is public, so you can steal the code and modify it for your own server ;) .
